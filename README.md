# T A M A R A F I

### A MEAN stack app that encourages exercise through a personal fitness friend. 


This app connects with Fitbit, Jawbone, or Misfit to track your health data (including fitness and sleep quality).  

The app encourages the user to meet their fitness goals through several mechanics:

* The pet's fitness will mirror that of the user. The creature's appearance will change depending on whether the user is meeting his or her goals.
If a user is active, his tamarafi will be healthy, his crib will be decked out in swag, and he will perform well in tug-of-war. 
If is a user is inactive and leading an unhealthy lifestyle, his tamarafi will be unhealthy and self-loathing.

* Achieving goals will earn the user points which he or she can use to purchase items in the store, such as hats, clothes and furniture for the pet.

* Users' tamarafis can post encaouraging messages for one another and play competitive mini-games, where their performance will be influenced by their owner's
fitness level.
